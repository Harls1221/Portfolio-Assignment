        <p>Hi there and welcome! I started painting as a hobby when I was in Highschool. After graduating in 2012, I barely picked up a paintbrush for over 4 years. Watercolor had always been my favorite medium in high school so I decided that would be the medium I would pick back up again. I painted every chance I got after I received my own watercolor palette, and I haven’t stopped since. I began to post my work and then created my Etsy shop called Harley Artly (I still don’t understand how I came up with that name.) I began to sell hand painted bookmarks in my online shop and to my friends and family. Once I moved to Orlando, I wanted to have a go at pet portraits and so my very first pet painting was of my very own Pitbull, Oliver. I posted the finished results and suddenly I was busy painting other pet portraits for paying customers! So far, I have only painted dogs and cats. I am still waiting to paint an exotic animal for someone.
        <br> 
        I grew up in Crescent City, Florida. A small town with only one stop light in the center. The 20 acres of land I was raised on was my own personal playground and we had cattle (I named every single one of those cows, too). Besides painting, I love to garden. I love to grow my own food and practice sustainability. I am passionate about our Earth and I am always seeking ways to live a sustainable lifestyle.
